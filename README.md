# MIDILodica

This repository contains all the files needed to 3D print and manufacture the MIDILodica, a breath-controlled MIDI device.

## Parts list

To build the MIDILodica, you will need the following:

- **40 x TL1105SPF160Q Tactile Switch** (can be substituted with TL1240NQ1JBLK if you don't have access to a 3D printer)
- **1x Adafruit 320x172 TFT Display - ST7789 (5393)**
- **1x Arduino Micro**
- **40x 1N4148 Through-hole diodes**
- **1x 66226-003LF 3-position header connector**
- **1x ABPDANT005PGAA5 Honeywell pressure sensor**
- **1x SEN-08680 50mm Softpot**

You will also need to obtain a printed circuit board (PCB) with a PCB manufacturing service. The required files are in a .zip in the `/manufacturing/gerber` folder.
